The **Fake News Detector** is a Data Science project that uses machine learning algorithms to identify whether a news article is **Fake** or **Real**. By leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and a Naive Bayes classifier, this tool automates the detection of misinformation in real-time.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies & Tools  

- **Python**: Primary language for data manipulation and machine learning.  
- **Scikit-learn**: For building the classification model using Multinomial Naive Bayes.  
- **NLTK**: For text preprocessing (stopword removal, tokenization, etc.).  
- **Flask**: Web framework to deploy the model as a real-time application.  
- **HTML/CSS**: For creating a user-friendly interface.  
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: For exploratory data analysis and model prototyping.

1. **Data Collection**:  
   - A dataset containing labeled news articles (*Fake* and *Real*) is used to train the model.  

2. **Text Preprocessing**:  
   - **Tokenization**: Breaking text into words or tokens.  
   - **Stopwords Removal**: Removing common words like ‚Äúthe‚Äù, ‚Äúis‚Äù, etc., that do not contribute to the meaning.  
   - **Lemmatization**: Reducing words to their base forms (e.g., ‚Äúrunning‚Äù ‚Üí ‚Äúrun‚Äù).  

3. **Feature Extraction**:  
   - **TF-IDF Vectorizer**: Converts the text into numerical features (importance of words in the article).  

4. **Model Training**:  
   - A Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier is trained on the processed text data to classify articles as *Fake* or *Real*.  

5. **Real-Time Prediction**:  
   - Users can paste news articles into the web app, and the model will classify them instantly based on the trained data.
