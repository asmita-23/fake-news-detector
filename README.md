Fake News Detector
This project is a Fake News Detection system built using machine learning techniques, specifically focused on detecting whether news articles are real or fake. The model uses text classification algorithms and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze news content.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to identify fake news articles based on their textual content. The system uses the Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm, which is a popular model for text classification tasks. It is trained on a dataset of news articles, where each article is labeled as either Fake or Real.

The model works by transforming the raw text into numerical features using the TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) method. After training, it predicts the category (Fake or Real) for new, unseen news articles.

Key Features:
Text Preprocessing: Removing stop words, tokenizing text, and cleaning up the input data.
TF-IDF Vectorization: Converts text data into a numerical form suitable for machine learning models.
Model Training: Uses Multinomial Naive Bayes to train the model on labeled news data.
Prediction: Allows users to input a news article and classify it as either fake or real.
Technologies Used
Python: The programming language used for data analysis and model implementation.
Scikit-learn: A machine learning library used for building and training the model.
NLTK: A library for natural language processing, used for text preprocessing.
Pandas: Used for handling and manipulating datasets.
Matplotlib/Seaborn: For visualizing model performance.
How It Works
Data Collection: The project relies on a dataset containing news articles, each labeled as Fake or Real.
Preprocessing: Text data is cleaned and transformed using TF-IDF.
Model Training: A Naive Bayes classifier is trained using the processed data.
Prediction: Once trained, the model can predict whether a new article is Fake or Real based on its content.
Example Usage
After training the model, you can classify a new piece of news text like so:

python
Copy code
news_input = "The stock market has been rising due to increased investor confidence."
result = predict_news(news_input)
display_result(news_input, result)
This will display whether the news article is Fake or Real based on the modelâ€™s prediction.
